# **Stock-Analysis** #
Performance analysis of all stocks in 2017 and 2018.
---
### **Overview of Project** ###
---
###### This project entails the total daily volume and yearly return of all stocks in 2017 and 2018. The purpose of this analyis is to provide context for which Steve may use in deciding on which stocks to invest in. ######

### **Results** ###
---
###### According to this analysis, the majority of the stocks including DQ presented with a higher performance in 2017 than 2018. This was assesed by calculating the total daily volume and yearly return of each stock using `For` loop code and `If` code. The code was then refractored and the execution times of the 2 codes were compared. The refractored script took a shorter time to execute than the original script. Using 2018 as an example, the original script execution time was about 4.26 seconds, which compared to the refractored code's time (shown in imagine below) is longer.

### **Summary** ###
---
###### The obvious advantage of refactoring code is the decrease in execution time. Due to the higher efficiancy of the recfactored code, less memory is used, which is also a plus. However, there can be disadvantages to the refactoring process. It may take longer than expected to refactor the code, which is not efficient, and it is easy to overlook key steps in the analysis if the code is over simplified. ######

###### I took these pros and cons into consideration as I was refractoring the original VBA script. I ran into issues with my code where I missed a step and it would not run. The debugging process did take longer than expected, but the end result was successfull in reducing the execution time.* ######
